npm run lint - runs eslint/check for errors   
npm start - runs server normally   
npm run dev - uns it via nodemon, which watches the src/** folder for any changes, restarting the server whenever something is updated;   
npm debug - debug is the same as dev but also starts the node inspector on port 9229, so that you can attach a debugger
